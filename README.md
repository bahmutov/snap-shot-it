# snap-shot-it

> Smarter snapshot utility for Mocha and BDD test runners + data-driven testing!

## Why

This tool makes [snapshot testing][snapshot testing] for Mocha (and other BDD)
frameworks quick and painless. This module spies on global `it` function,
which allows it to accurately get test information (beating static code parsing
done in [snap-shot][snap-shot]); it should work in transpiled code.

This package uses [snap-shot-compare](https://github.com/bahmutov/snap-shot-compare)
to display object and text difference intelligently.

This function also includes [data-driven][data-driven] testing mode,
similar to [sazerac][sazerac], see [Data-driven testing](#data-driven-testing)
section below.

## Install

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 4 or above.

```sh
npm install --save-dev snap-shot-it
```

## Use

Example from [spec.js](src/spec.js)

```js
const snapshot = require('snap-shot-it')
describe('example', () => {
  it('works', () => {
    snapshot(add(10, 20))
    snapshot('a text message')
    return Promise.resolve(42).then(snapshot)
  })
})
```

Run Mocha tests, then open the created
[__snapshots__/spec.js](__snapshots__/spec.js) file

```js
exports['example works 1'] = 30

exports['example works 2'] = "a text message"

exports['example works 3'] = 42
```

Suppose you change the resolved value from `42` to `80`

```js
const snapshot = require('snap-shot-it')
describe('example', () => {
  it('works', () => {
    snapshot(add(10, 20))
    snapshot('a text message')
    return Promise.resolve(80).then(snapshot)
  })
})
```

The test will fail

```
1) example works:
   Error: 42 !== 80
```

The error message should intelligently handle numbers, objects, arrays,
multi-line text, etc.

## Advanced use

You can see the saves snapshot values by running with environment variable

```bash
SNAPSHOT_SHOW=1 npm test
```

You can see snapshot values without writing them into the snapshot file

```bash
SNAPSHOT_DRY=1 npm test
```

You can update snapshot values

```bash
SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 npm test
```

If you want to sort saved snapshots alphabetically, run with

```bash
SNAPSHOT_SORT=1 npm test
```

## Named snapshots

Renaming tests might lead to confusion and pruning snapshots. You can name the snapshots
yourself

```js
const value = 42
snapshot('my name', value)
```

The snapshots will be saved as

```js
exports['my name'] = 42
```

**Note** you should make sure that the name is unique per spec file.

## Pruning

If the test run is successful and executed _all_ tests (there was no `.only`) then snapshots without a test are pruned.

## Data-driven testing

Writing multiple input / output pairs for a function under test quickly
becomes tedious. Luckily, you can test a function by providing multiple
inputs and a single snapshot of function's *behavior* will be saved.

```js
// checks if n is prime
const isPrime = n => ...
it('tests prime', () => {
  snapshot(isPrime, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
})
```

The saved snapshot file will have clear mapping between given input and
produced result

```js
// snapshot file
exports['tests prime 1'] = {
  "name": "isPrime",
  "behavior": [
    {
      "given": 1,
      "expect": false
    },
    {
      "given": 2,
      "expect": true
    },
    {
      "given": 3,
      "expect": true
    },
    {
      "given": 4,
      "expect": false
    },
    {
      "given": 5,
      "expect": true
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

You can also test functions that expect multiple arguments by providing
arrays of inputs.

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b
it('checks behavior of binary function add', () => {
  snapshot(add, [1, 2], [2, 2], [-5, 5], [10, 11])
})
```

Again, the snapshot file gives clear picture of the `add` behavior

```js
// snapshot file
exports['checks behavior of binary function add 1'] = {
  "name": "add",
  "behavior": [
    {
      "given": [
        1,
        2
      ],
      "expect": 3
    },
    {
      "given": [
        2,
        2
      ],
      "expect": 4
    },
    {
      "given": [
        -5,
        5
      ],
      "expect": 0
    },
    {
      "given": [
        10,
        11
      ],
      "expect": 21
    }
  ]
}
```

See [src/data-driven-spec.js](src/data-driven-spec.js) for more examples.

## Debugging

Run with environment variable `DEBUG=snap-shot-it ...` to see log messages.
Because under the hood it uses [snap-shot-core][snap-shot-core] you might
want to show messages from both libraries with `DEBUG=snap-shot* ...`

## Examples

### TypeScript

An example using [ts-mocha](https://github.com/piotrwitek/ts-mocha) is
shown in folder [ts-demo](ts-demo)

### CoffeeScript

CoffeeScript example is in [coffee-demo](coffee-demo) folder. Watch mode is
working properly.

## Inspiration

Came during WorkBar Cambridge Happy Hour on the terrace as I was thinking about
difficulty of adding CoffeeScript / TypeScript support to
[snap-shot][snap-shot] project. Got the idea of overriding `global.it` when
loading `snap-shot` because a day before I wrote [repeat-it][repeat-it]
which overrides it and it is very simple [repeat/src/index.js][repeat source].

This NPM module is part of my experiments with snapshot testing. There are
lots of other ones, blog posts and slides on this topic.

* [snap-shot-core][snap-shot-core] implements loading and saving snapshots
* [snap-shot](https://github.com/bahmutov/snap-shot) is an alternative to this
  package that tries to determine spec name using stack trace and static
  source code parsing. Hard to do for transpiled code!
